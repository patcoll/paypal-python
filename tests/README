In order to run these tests, you must copy the included api_details_blank.py
file to api_details.py and substitute the API credential placeholders with your
own PayPal test account credentials. All tests will fail unless you do this.

Once your credentials are in place, you'll want to run the tests through
the runner.py module:

    python runnery.py
